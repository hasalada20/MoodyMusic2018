# MoodyMusic2018

## Mood Music 1.0 -- December 5, 2018

### Here is what is new in Mood Music 1.0, the final version of Mood Music that will be demonstrated in Dr. Moorman's Software Engineering class during the Fall 2018 semester!

## Hear your music!
#### You can now hear your music! Select a progression and then hit play to hear the progressions that were created through the magic of your specified presets. You can also click on a chord individually to see what it sounds like by itself!

#### Chord diagrams will be highlighted based on which one is currently being played in the progression.

## Chord diagrams
#### Forget how to play the chord? Chord diagrams are displayed automatically for you! Click on the chord to hear it.

## Redesign
#### A beautiful yet basic redesign of the site provides for a simple and easy to use layout all while not taking away from the important aspect of the site: the music.

## We hope you enjoy using Mood Music!

##### Currently known issues
- Selecting mood changes what style is selected but does not genuinely update it.
- Chords do not highlight on individual clicks.
- Timing of progression playing is slightly wonky.
- The play button or chord can be pressed repeatedly for a nasty mess of music.
- This git is named MoodyMusic, but we've changed it to MoodMusic.
